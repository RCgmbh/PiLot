# PiLot - getting started
## Install the PiLot web application

The core of the PiLot is a web application, which provides all data and functionality. The web application is made of different elements. One is the static website, containing the html and javascript files. The other part ist the REST API, which is called by the javascript within the website, and grants reading and writing access to the data, which is saved partly in files and partly in a postgreSQL database. A webserver (nginx, say "engine-X") is used to make all this glory available. Sounds complicated, but actually isn't, as most of the work already has been done for you, and the entire installation in this chapter is automated with scripts.

All scripts are in the pilotinstall directory, and some of them only work when called from within this directory, so please make sure you are at the right place:

```
cd ~/pilotinstall
```
We first install the .net core runtime, postgreSQL and nginx. Just enter 
```
sudo sh 02-install-platform.sh
```
To check whether the installation was successful, enter 
```
dotnet --list-runtimes
```
This will give you a list of the installed runtimes, and should list Microsoft.AspNetCore.App and Microsoft.NETCore.App.

Next, install the actual PiLot application components and set up the database, again by just calling a script:
```
sudo sh 03-install-pilotweb.sh
```
Now, another big moment has come, and your PiLot should already work (at least a bit). Take a device, that is connected to the PiLot, open your favourite browser, and in the addess bar, enter the following URL:
- If the device is connected to the PiLot access point, enter http://192.168.80.1 (if you changed the static IP, enter the IP address you have set)
- If the device is in the same network as the pilot (e.g. your home Wi-Fi), enter http://pilot or http://pilot.local, (replace "pilot" by the hostname you gave to your raspi).
- If you are directly working on your raspberry pi, enter http://localhost

You will see the PiLot start page, but as you have no map data, no GPS and no sensors yet, this will appear a bit empty, and it might still be a bit difficult to grasp the beauty of it all. But we will work on this. For now we just want to update some basic settings and download a few map tiles (the images that make the map). 

### Basic Settings
#### Language
You can change the user interface language of the PiLot web application. Currently, english and german are supported. To change the language, click on the "Settings" icon, looking like an equalizer with three sliders (on smaller screens, you have to click the "hamburger"-icon (â˜°) first). There you will find the "Language" icon. Click it, and select the language. The language setting will be saved on the device, which means you can have a different language on different devices accessing your PiLot.

#### Boat Time
The PiLot uses a concept called "Boat Time". It's basically the UTC offset your PiLot uses. As a boat typically crosses timezones every now and then (think of the British Channel), it's a common scenario to change timezones on the PiLot, and it can easily be done in the web application. It's best to keep the operating system based on UTC, and just change the Boat Time as needed. Click the icon "Boat time" on the settings page, and use the +1/-1 links to adjust the offset.

#### Download Tiles
To make your PiLot web application look a bit better, download a few map tiles. When on the settings page, click on the "Tools" icon in the top navigation, looking like a hammer and wrench. From there, select "Local Maps". This will show a page containing some options and a map (note that your PiLot needs to have internet access for this). Move the map to the area you are interested in, then check the two checkboxes below the "download"-icon. In the two dropdown menues, you can choose how many zoom levels you want do download. Select "all" in the first dropdown, and "1" in the second. Now, when you slowly pan or zoom the map, everything you see on the map will be saved locally, as well as all lower and one higher zoom level. As soon as you have downloaded a few tiles, click on the "map"-icon in the left-side navigation. The map you see here (as opposed to the map on the tiles download page) is made up entirely of your local data, and thus will be available offline.

Click on the "home" icon to return to the start page, and save that page to your favourites. On an android device, if you add the page to your start screen, it will then open in a nice fullscreen window.

In later chapters we will customize the boat image and add sensors, so that there will be more meaningful data displayed on the start page. But first, we dive into the gps topic.
