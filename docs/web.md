# PiLot - getting started
## Install nginx and set up the web application

The core of the PiLot is a web application, which provides all data and functionality. The web application is made of different elements. One is the static website, containing the html and javascript files. The other part ist the REST API, which is called by the javascript within the website, and grants reading and writing access to the data. A webserver (nginx, say "engine-X") is used to make all this glory available. Sounds complicated, but actually isn't, as most of the work already has been done for you.
