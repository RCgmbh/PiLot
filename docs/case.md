# PiLot - getting started
## Optimize your system

Now it's time to work with your hands. Your PiLot of course needs a nice case. Depending on how many components you used (gps, sensors), and whether you want to have an inbuilt battery or powerbank, and of course depending on the Raspberry Pi form factor you chose, you will end up with either a tiny or a bit bigger device. Of course you can buy a ready-to use case, 3d-print one or take a piece of plywood and a fretsaw and build something from scratch.

Keep these points in mind:

- **Water protection**: Depending on how you are going to use your PiLot, the required protection level against water will vary. Plan for your specific requirements and do test without any components inside before you drown your PiLot. Also bear in mind that achieving a completely waterproof case is extremely difficult.
- **Heat**: Again depending on the type of Raspberry Pi you use, it will produce more or less heat. When trying to achieve a water protected case, cooling will be quite a challenge. Do some research, do some test and decide for yourself what the best solution is.

Good luck!

When you're done with the handicraft, let's get back to some computer stuffs. But we remain in the creative corner for a while:
