# PiLot - getting started
This guide will lead you through the steps of building up your own Raspberry Pi based boating system - the PiLot. You don't need any special knowledge - if you can do basic stuff with a computer, have some endurance and a lot of couriosity, then you will make it.

If everything goes well, you should be done with the software-part within an afternoon. But better reserve a full weekend. When it comes to building a nice case, you can of course spend an infinite amount of time (it's called 'hobby').

Each of the following chapters contains a part of the entire setup process. Some of them are mandatory, others are optional. Some are easy, others a bit more complicated. So, cast off!

1. [Prerequisites](prerequisites.md)
2. [Operating system and basic configuration](basics.md)
3. [Set up a wireless access point](ap.md)
4. [Install the web application](web.md)
5. [Connect a GPS device and set up the GPS logging service](gps.md)
6. [Install the photos import service](photoimport.md)
7. [Connect sensors and log sensor data](sensors.md)
8. [Optimize your system](optimize.md)
