# PiLot - getting started
This guide will lead you through the steps of building up your own Raspberry Pi based boating system - the PiLot. You don't need any special knowledge - if you can do basic stuff with a computer, you should be fine. Some of the steps are optional, so don't worry if the guide at first appears quite long. If everything goes well, you should be done within an afternoon. But better reserve a full weekend.
