# PiLot
## Publish data

You can publish data from one PiLot to another PiLot. This is helpful if you have multiple devices and want to sync data between them. Or if you want to publish data to a public website. For example, you can publish your live position data using the [live tracking service](live.md) when you're underway, and at the end of the day additionally publish your logbook, diary and photos. The publishing feature lets you select in detail what you want to publish or not.
